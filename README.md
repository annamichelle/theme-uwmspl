##Features

###Item Pages
* Item pages use [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) to display files
* Item show pages include a "return to exhibit" link, rather than a previous/next item browse

###Exhibits
* Changes to the exhibit summary page:
  * After the exhibit description, an optional "Continue to Exhibit" link takes readers to the first page of the exhibit 
  * Exhibit credits have replaced the navigation in the secondary (right-hand) sidebar on the Summary page
  * Using the theme configuration, admin can decide how to show a "Contents" section below the exhibit description. Options include:
    * no table of contents
