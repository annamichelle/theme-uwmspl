============

An Omeka theme for UWM Libraries Special Collections exhibits that offers multiple style sheets and other customizations.

##Features

###Item Pages
* Item pages use [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) to display files
* Items include a "Appears in Exhibit" section if the item appears in a **public** exhibit
* Item show pages include a "return to exhibit" link, rather than a previous/next item browse

###Exhibits
* Changes to the exhibit summary page:
  * After the exhibit description, a "Continue to Exhibit" link takes readers to the first page of the exhibit 
  * Exhibit credits have replaced the navigation in the secondary (right-hand) sidebar
  * Using the theme configuration, admin can decide whether to show a "Contents" section below the exhibit description. This list of pages can be displayed
    * in a [jQuery accordion](http://jqueryui.com/accordion/)
    * as a plain-text list
* Custom navigation within the exhibit hides extra information, showing only pages relevant to the current one
